- `remove_last()` - removes the last node and returns its value
- `insert_before(node, value)` - insert an element with the given value before the given node
- `insert_after(node, value)` - insert an element with the given value after the given node
- `find(val)` - returns the first node that has the given value or null if no such value exists
- `values()` - returns all values as a tuple
- `head` - reference to the head node
- `tail` - reference to the tail node
- `count` - returns the number of nodes
