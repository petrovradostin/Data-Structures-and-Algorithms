### Queue
#### Description
The queue is a very useful data structure providing *first-in first-out* element access. It is most useful when an algorithm depends on such an access (such as Scheduling and BFS).

#### Task
Queue class is providing the following functionality:
- `enqueue()` - adds an element to the end of the queue
- `dequeue()` - removes the element from the front of the queue
- `peek()` - returns the value of the front element without removing it
- `count` - returns the number of elements in the queue
- `is_empty` - returns a bool indicating whether the queue is empty

### Stack
#### Description
Similar to the queue, the stack is a very useful data structure, providing *last-in first-out* element access. As with the queue, it is most useful when an algorithm depends on such an access (such as DFS, Undo/Redo functionality, the Call Stack).

#### Task
Stack class is providing the following functionality:
- `push()` - adds an element to the top of the stack
- `pop()` - removes the element from the top of the stack
- `peek()` - returns the value of the top element without removing it
- `count` - returns the number of elements in the stack
- `is_empty` - returns a boolean indicating whether the stack is empty
